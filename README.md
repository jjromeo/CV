===========================

I'm a graduate from Makers Academy who is passionate about learning more about software development, web technologies and computer science. Having completed the course and developed a preference for full stack development, I am now ready to start my career in this field.

| This was my final project. Working in a team of four, we created a location-based social network for connecting freelancers and remote workers. <br> Technologies used include: Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, GMaps, Javascript, jQuery.Rspec, Capybara and Poltergeist were used for the testing.  <br> [View Fhellow] | This was one of the challenges given during the course. I created a clone of the webapp twitter. My iteration allows users to sign up, Tweet including hashtags which are rendered as clickable links, and follow other users. <br> Technologies used include: Ruby, Sinatra, Postgres, Bcrypt, HAML, CSS. Rspec and Capybara were used for the testing.  <br>| In preparation for the technical tests I will need to complete, I created a cinema booking system that is able to read a file and book seats in a cinema accordingly.<br> This was made using Ruby, with Rspec for the testing.


Web development
---------------

Computers and technology have always been my thing, however never professionally, up until now. Having enjoyed doing numerous online tutorials and research in web development, I had been looking to enter the field professionally for a while and joined Makers to make this happen. The 12 weeks of continuous coding and learning quickly confirmed my suspicions that this was the field I wanted to be in.
